    faqs: [
      { question: "Native vs cross-platform—which is better for my app?", answer: "Native (Swift/Kotlin) gives the best performance and platform-specific UX per OS but requires two codebases and higher cost. Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) lets you ship one codebase to both iOS and Android, reducing time and cost while still delivering a strong experience. We recommend based on your goals, budget, and need for platform-specific features. For most business and productivity apps, cross-platform is a great balance. For graphics-heavy or highly native-feeling apps, we can discuss a native or hybrid approach." },
      { question: "Do you handle App Store and Play Store submission?", answer: "Yes. We build, test, and guide you through the full submission process for both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This includes preparing assets (icons, screenshots, descriptions), configuring app metadata and privacy settings, and following each store’s guidelines. We help you respond to review feedback and set up the process for future updates. Many clients hand us the requirements and we take care of the submission steps so you can focus on your business." },
      { question: "How much does mobile app development cost?", answer: "Cost depends on scope, features, and platforms. Simple apps (e.g. MVP with core flows) can start in the lower range; more complex apps with custom backends, integrations, or advanced UX cost more. We provide transparent, fixed or phased quotes after scoping your requirements. We often break work into phases (e.g. MVP first, then enhancements) so you can manage budget and launch sooner. We’ll outline options and recommend an approach that fits your goals and timeline." },
      { question: "Can you build for both iOS and Android with one codebase?", answer: "Yes. Using React Native or Flutter we build a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android. This reduces development time and cost compared to maintaining two separate native apps, while still delivering a smooth, native-feeling experience. We handle platform-specific tweaks where needed (e.g. navigation, permissions, store requirements). You get one codebase to maintain, one release cycle, and consistent features across both platforms unless you choose to differentiate." },
      { question: "Do you provide app maintenance and updates after launch?", answer: "Yes. We offer maintenance and support plans that include bug fixes, compatibility updates for new OS versions, security patches, and optional feature additions. This keeps your app running smoothly as Apple and Google release updates and as your business evolves. We can also help with store listing updates, analytics, and performance tuning. Many clients start with post-launch support and then add new features in follow-on phases." },

    faqs: [
      { question: "Do I need a lot of data to get started with ML?", answer: "It depends on the use case. Some solutions work well with smaller datasets or pre-trained models (e.g. for classification or sentiment). Others, like custom recommendation engines or highly specific predictors, benefit from more data. We assess your data availability, quality, and goals and recommend the best approach—whether that’s starting with a pre-trained model, collecting more data, or using synthetic or augmented data where appropriate. We can also design a phased plan: start with a simpler model and improve as you gather more data." },
      { question: "Can you integrate AI/ML with our existing software?", answer: "Yes. We design AI/ML solutions to fit into your current systems. We build APIs, microservices, or embedded modules that connect to your existing apps, databases, and workflows. Integration can include real-time inference, batch processing, or event-driven pipelines. We work with your tech stack and security requirements so the AI layer is maintainable and scalable. Whether you use CRM, ERP, or custom tools, we ensure the ML component fits cleanly into your architecture." },
      { question: "What types of AI and ML solutions do you build?", answer: "We build a range of AI/ML solutions: predictive analytics and forecasting, natural language processing (chatbots, text classification, summarization), computer vision (image/video analysis, object detection), recommendation systems, and process automation. We tailor each solution to your use case, data, and constraints. We use both custom models (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and third-party APIs (e.g. OpenAI) where they add value. We’ll recommend the right mix of build vs. buy for your goals and budget." },
      { question: "How long does an AI/ML project typically take?", answer: "Timeline varies with complexity. Simple integrations or proof-of-concepts can be done in a few weeks. Custom model training, evaluation, and deployment might take one to three months. Large-scale or regulated deployments can extend further. We provide a clear timeline after reviewing your data, success criteria, and integration needs. We often deliver in phases: a working prototype or MVP first, then iteration and production hardening, so you see value early and can adjust priorities." },
      { question: "Do you use OpenAI or other third-party AI APIs?", answer: "Yes, when they’re the right fit. We use OpenAI and other third-party APIs for tasks like language understanding, generation, or embeddings when they offer the best balance of quality and cost. We also build and train custom models when you need full control, specific domain performance, or strict data privacy. We recommend based on your requirements: speed to market, cost, accuracy, and where your data can live. We can also combine APIs with custom logic for hybrid solutions." },

You can start with one channel (e.g. website) and add more later. We design the conversation logic once and adapt the connectors per channel, so the experience stays consistent. We’ll recommend the best channels based on your audience and support workflow." },
      { question: "How do you train and improve the chatbot?", answer: "We start with your existing content: FAQs, help articles, and sample conversations. For rule-based or intent-based bots we define intents, entities, and flows. For more advanced, open-ended conversation we use NLP and optional LLM integration (e.g. OpenAI) with careful prompting and guardrails. We tune the bot using real conversations and feedback, and we can add human handoff when the bot can’t resolve an issue. Training is iterative—we refine over time so the bot gets better at handling your actual use cases." },
      { question: "Can your chatbots handle multiple languages?", answer: "Yes. We build multi-language chatbots that can detect the user’s language or let them choose, and respond in that language. This is especially useful for global support or regional sites. We work with your translated content or integrate with translation services where needed. Language handling is built into the design from the start so adding or changing languages later is straightforward." },
      { question: "Do you integrate chatbots with CRMs and support tools?", answer: "Yes. We integrate with popular CRMs and support platforms such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, and others, as well as custom systems via APIs. Conversations can create or update leads and tickets, sync contact and activity data, and trigger workflows (e.g. assign to an agent). This keeps your team in the loop and ensures no lead or issue falls through the cracks. We’ll map the fields and flows you need during the design phase." },
      { question: "What's the cost of a custom chatbot?", answer: "Cost depends on complexity and scope. Simple FAQ or rule-based bots with a single channel are more affordable. AI-powered conversational bots with multiple channels, CRM integration, and custom training cost more. We provide a clear quote after scoping: we’ll define the flows, channels, and integrations you need and outline optional phases (e.g. start with website only, then add WhatsApp and CRM). That way you can align the solution with your budget and priorities." },

      { question: "What's included in a maintenance and support plan?", answer: "Our maintenance plans typically include regular updates (dependencies, frameworks, and security patches), bug fixes, and monitoring of your application’s health and performance. We can also include database maintenance, backup checks, and optional 24/7 support depending on your SLA needs. We tailor each plan to your stack (e.g. React, Node, WordPress) and your priorities—whether that’s stability, speed of response, or room for small feature improvements. You’ll get a clear scope and response-time commitment so you know what to expect." },
      { question: "Can you take over maintenance of an existing project?", answer: "Yes. We regularly onboard existing codebases from other teams or vendors. We start by reviewing the architecture, dependencies, and deployment setup, then we document the system and any quirks. We set up monitoring, alerting, and support workflows so we can respond quickly to issues. We’re comfortable working with a wide range of technologies and can suggest improvements (e.g. security, performance, or maintainability) as we go. Handover usually includes a transition period so we’re fully up to speed before you rely on us for ongoing support." },
      { question: "What is your typical response time for issues?", answer: "We offer tiered SLAs to match your needs. Standard plans typically include a 24–48 hour response for non-critical issues. Priority plans can offer same-day response or 24/7 coverage for critical outages. We define “critical” with you (e.g. site down, payment flow broken) and ensure those get immediate attention. Response time is the time until we acknowledge and start working on the issue; resolution time depends on complexity and we keep you updated throughout." },
      { question: "Do you provide regular reports on maintenance and uptime?", answer: "Yes. We send regular status reports that can include uptime and availability summaries, a list of changes and deployments, security and dependency updates, and recommendations for improvements. Reporting frequency (e.g. monthly or quarterly) and format are agreed in your plan. This keeps you informed without needing to chase updates and helps with internal reporting or compliance if required." },
      { question: "Can I scale up support during busy periods or for special projects?", answer: "Yes. We offer flexible add-ons such as extra retainer hours or on-demand support for busy seasons, product launches, or one-off projects. You can scale up when you need more capacity and scale back when things are quiet. We’ll outline how to request and use additional hours so you’re never stuck when demand spikes." },

      { question: "Which cloud providers do you use for deployment?", answer: "We work with major cloud providers including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (GCP), as well as platforms like Vercel and Netlify for front-end or full-stack apps. We choose based on your application type, scale, budget, and any compliance or data-residency requirements. We can also design multi-cloud or hybrid setups if needed. Our goal is to give you a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective environment without locking you into a single vendor unnecessarily." },
      { question: "Do you provide documentation and handover for the infrastructure?", answer: "Yes. We deliver documentation that typically includes architecture overviews, runbooks for common operations and incidents, and details of how to run deployments and rollbacks. We also do handover sessions with your team so you understand how the system works and how to extend it. This makes it easier for you to operate the system in-house or hand it to another provider later if needed." },
      { question: "How long does deployment and DevOps setup typically take?", answer: "It depends on complexity. A simple static or single-service deployment (e.g. to Vercel or a single server) can be done in 1–2 days. More complex setups—multiple services, databases, CI/CD, and staging environments—often take 1–2 weeks. Large or regulated environments can take longer. We provide a timeline during the planning phase and keep you updated. We can also phase the work (e.g. get production live first, then add full CI/CD and monitoring) so you see value quickly." },
      { question: "Do you set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments?", answer: "Yes. We configure continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or provider-native options (e.g. AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps). Pipelines typically run tests, build artifacts, and deploy to staging and production with approval steps where you want them. This reduces manual errors and speeds up releases. We tailor the pipeline to your repo structure, test suite, and release process so it fits your workflow." },
      { question: "Can you migrate our app from another host or cloud?", answer: "Yes. We handle migrations from shared hosting, VPS, legacy servers, or other clouds. We plan the move to minimize downtime—often with a cutover window and rollback plan—and we migrate data, DNS, and configuration as needed. We’ll outline the steps, risks, and timeline before starting so you know what to expect. Post-migration we verify functionality and performance and can stay on for ongoing support." },

      { question: "What file formats do you deliver for design work?", answer: "We deliver all standard formats you’re likely to need: PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, and source files (e.g. Figma, AI, PSD) as agreed. We’ll confirm formats and resolutions (e.g. for web vs. print) at the start of the project so you have everything for your website, social, ads, and print. If you need something specific (e.g. animated GIF, Lottie, or print-ready CMYK), we’ll include that in the scope." },
      { question: "Do you do video and motion graphics?", answer: "Yes. We offer video editing and motion graphics for social media, ads, and marketing. This can include short promotional clips, social reels, or animated explainers. Scope and length affect timeline and cost; we’ll outline options when you share your goals. We can work from your raw footage or stock, and we align with your brand so video feels consistent with the rest of your visuals." },
      { question: "How many revision rounds are included?", answer: "We typically include 2–3 rounds of revisions in the quoted price so you can refine designs without extra cost. Additional rounds can be added for a fee if needed. We clarify the number of rounds and what’s in scope (e.g. layout vs. copy changes) before starting so everyone is aligned. Our aim is to get to a result you’re happy with within the agreed scope." },
      { question: "Do you create brand guidelines?", answer: "Yes. For logo and brand identity projects we deliver a style guide that covers logo usage, colors, typography, and tone so your team and partners can keep the brand consistent. The guide can be a PDF or a simple document; we’ll tailor it to your size and needs. This helps when you brief other designers or use templates for social, ads, or internal materials." },
      { question: "What's the typical turnaround time for design projects?", answer: "Turnaround depends on the project. Simple graphics or one-off assets often ship in 2–3 days. Logos and full branding usually take 1–2 weeks to allow for concepts and revisions. Larger projects (e.g. full brand plus multiple applications) are scheduled in phases. We’ll give you a timeline and milestones at the start so you can plan launches and campaigns around delivery." },

We recommend a minimum that allows meaningful testing and learning (often in the low thousands per month for a single campaign type). We’ll propose a budget based on your goals, competition, and expected CPCs so you get the best return. We can start smaller and scale as results justify it, or plan a larger launch if you have clear targets and timeline." },
      { question: "Do you set up and verify conversion tracking?", answer: "Yes. We implement and verify conversion tracking (e.g. Google Ads conversion actions, GA4 events) so you can measure leads, sign-ups, or sales from your campaigns. Correct tracking is essential for optimization and ROI reporting. We’ll outline what we need (e.g. access to your site or tag manager) and confirm that conversions are firing correctly before scaling spend." },
      { question: "Which Google Ads types do you run?", answer: "We run Search, Display, YouTube, Shopping, and Performance Max campaigns depending on your goals and audience. Search is often the core for lead gen or direct response; Display and YouTube help with reach and retargeting; Shopping suits e-commerce. We choose the mix and structure based on your products, funnel, and budget, and we can add or pause campaign types as goals evolve." },
      { question: "How often do you optimize Google Ads campaigns?", answer: "We optimize continuously: adjusting keyword bids, ad copy, and landing pages based on performance data. You’ll get regular reports (weekly or monthly) and strategy calls so you’re up to date on changes and results. For larger accounts we may do more frequent checks; for smaller ones we still ensure nothing is left unoptimized. We’ll agree on the right rhythm for your account size and goals." },
      { question: "Do you need access to my Google Ads account?", answer: "Yes. We work as an agency partner with read/write access so we can manage campaigns, set up conversion tracking, and run optimizations. We’ll guide you through the secure setup (e.g. inviting our account as a manager) and we follow best practices so you stay in control. You can revoke access at any time and you retain full ownership of the account and data." },

We'll align campaign objectives with your business outcomes—for example, lead gen with forms or landing pages, or sales with catalog and conversion events. We can also run consideration objectives (e.g. video views, engagement) when that fits your strategy. We'll recommend the right mix and how to measure success." },

We design static images, carousels, and video ads that fit Meta's formats and best practices, or we can use and adapt your existing creative. We'll align with your brand guidelines and suggest A/B tests (e.g. different hooks, formats, or offers) to improve performance. If you need custom video or motion work, we can coordinate with our design partners so creative stays fresh and effective." },
      { question: "How do you target audiences?", answer: "We use a mix of targeting: interest-based and demographic targeting, lookalike audiences built from your customers or site visitors, custom audiences (e.g. email lists, website visitors, app users), and retargeting to bring back people who didn't convert. We'll structure campaigns and ad sets so we can learn and optimize, and we'll refine audiences over time based on performance and your goals." },
      { question: "What's the minimum ad spend?", answer: "We work with various budgets. We recommend a minimum that allows meaningful testing (often a few hundred to low thousands per month) so we can get statistically useful results before scaling. We'll be clear about what's realistic at your budget level, how we'll test and optimize, and when it makes sense to increase spend. Our goal is efficient use of every dollar." },
